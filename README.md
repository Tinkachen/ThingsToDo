The idea is not new. There are so much apps to organize the life. 
I found a great design by [Jae-seong, Jeong] (https://dribbble.com/shots/3812962-iPhone-X-Todo-Concept/) on dribbble that I want to realize. 
The gradient colors are from [coolhue] (https://webkul.github.io/coolhue/).
This is just a project for me to keep on programming. For hints and wishes I would be happy.
